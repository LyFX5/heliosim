> **An open framework for simulating socio-technical energy systems under uncertainty**

## Vision

HelioSim is a **generic, open simulation framework** for modeling microgrids, renewable forecasting, and adaptive control strategies — **without dependency on proprietary hardware, platforms, or client-specific logic**.

It is built to explore how energy, information, and human decisions interact as **living systems**, especially under conditions of uncertainty, feedback delays, and resource constraints.

This project is developed **independently** of any commercial engagement. It does **not contain, derive from, or replicate** proprietary systems, code, or architectures of any past or present client.

## Purpose

- Enable transparent, reproducible research in energy system modeling  
- Provide educational tools for understanding complex feedback in microgrids  
- Serve as a safe foundation for public demos, live streams, and tutorials  
- Demonstrate that **sovereign R&D** can coexist with open collaboration  

---

## What’s Included

- Physics-based models: PV, electrolyser (generic), battery, hydrogen tank  
- Time-series forecasting: irradiance, load, uncertainty (using public APIs)  
- Step-wise microgrid simulator with configurable topology  
- Rule-based control strategies (no RL yet — keeping it clean and safe)  
- Visualization and reporting utilities (HTML, Plotly, Jupyter)

All data sources are **public or synthetic**:
- [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) (weather)
- [PVGIS](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/) (solar potential)
- Stochastic load generators
