# HelioSim

An open framework for simulating socio-technical energy systems under uncertainty.

## Overview

HelioSim is a generic, open simulation framework for modeling microgrids, renewable forecasting, and adaptive control strategies — without dependency on proprietary hardware or client-specific logic.

It is designed for research, education, and transparent exploration of complex processes in energy systems.

All components are built using public data sources and general scientific methods.
